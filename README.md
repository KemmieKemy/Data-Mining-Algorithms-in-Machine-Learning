# Data-Mining-Algorithms-in-Machine-Learning
A collection of all the algorithms used for exploratory data analysis in Data Science.

This repository will contain all the data cleaning algorithms that are required for preproccessing before you actually start building a Machine Learning Model. You may get your changes merged here by submitting a Pull Request ðŸ”¥

## Q. How will I get my changes merged(how should I open a pull request)

A. You may propose your changes via a Pull Request. For how to open a pull request, give [this](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github) a read, if stuck, please ping anyone of the maintainers for help.

## Q. How should I begin contributing here?

A. Well, it is simple enough,follow the procedure

Read the repository,
Find the algorithm that you think is missing.
Now create and issue in this repository via clicking [here](https://github.com/hacktoberfest2k20/Data-Mining-Algorithms-in-Machine-Learning/issues),
Get yourself assigned to it(via commenting on the issue and tagging any of the maintainer)
Implement it, and create a pull request, we'll merge your PR very soon with minimal changes needed.

You may upload a notebook with .ipynb extension!!
